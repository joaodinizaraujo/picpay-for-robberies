# picpay-for-robberies
A stupid fake PicPay Android app so they don't steal your money!

## Roadmap

- ### Done
  - Copy the real PicPay UI

  - When the user tries to make a PIX, send an image from the front camera to Firebase with the latitude and longitude

  - When the user tries to make a PIX, play a loud sound

## Build
- Create a firebase project and copy your google-services.json file to the app folder
- Build the app using Android Studio and generate your .apk file
- Install the .apk file in your Android
